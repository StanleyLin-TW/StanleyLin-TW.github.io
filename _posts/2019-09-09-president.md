I was the president of IMSA in my junior year in university.  
( IMSA denotes to Information Management Student Association, which is the student association of department.)  


As a president, I coordinated with the faculties, professors and students to hold up events.  
I led over **200 members** and used the limited budget of **USD$ 6,500** to hold over 20 events. 
As a result, I cultivated my skills of leading and team-working during this year.   
  
Here are some events that I coordinated or cooperated with others during my term:  
- IM Uniform Day
- IM BBQ
- IM Food-run
- IM Year-end Celebration
- IM Christmas
- IM Picnic
- IM Alumni Presentation
- IM Week
- MakeNTU (Hackathon, cooperated with SA of ECE Department)
- IM Night
