### Data Description
Data is based on XXX airline's customer hisotry from 2013-2015.  
The attributes contained two categories of data:  
- Demographic data: Age, Gender, Member Status ...   
- Flight data: Flight number, Destination, Departure Time ...  
The raw data is quite sparse and biased, and thus we spent lots of time to conduct **data preprocessing**.  

### Data Preprocessing
Used Python to deal with data sparsity and bias.  
Toolkits used:  
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- panda
### Algorithms
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Singular Value Decomposition
