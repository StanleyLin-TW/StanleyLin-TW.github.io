title: BDA- Stock Trend Prediction

---
This was the midterm project of the course **Big Data and Business Analytics**.  
For this project, our goal is to predict future stock trend (up, down or neutral) based on news on companies.
It would be really helpful while making decisions of investing.

### Data Description  
Data Source: Professor.
- csv file of stock prices of Taiwan company in a month. 
- news in a month (in chinese)

We used news and prices from three companies: A, B, and C.  
Further, we define the classes and labelled each news based on following rules:  
- NODATA: If no price data (basically ignore)
- COMMON: |Price(Today+7)-Price(Today)|/Price(Today)<=0.05
- GOUP: Price(Today+7) > Price(Today) if not COMMON
- GODOWN: Price(Today+7) < Price(Today) if not COMMON

### Data Preprocessing
We used **two-gram partitioning** on news to generate keywords.  
To be mention, since the text is in Chinese, we will merge the words to N-gram if possible.  
For instance, A: 你 **好**+ B: **好** 嗎 -> 你好嗎  
Which the bold **好** is a shared word in A's tail and B's head.  

After getting the keywords, we define: 
- GOUP keywords: keyword from GOUP news, which are features indicating stock price increases
- GODOWN keywords: keyword from GODOWN news, which are features indicating stock price decreases

### Algorithms
We implemented KNN model for this problem:  

First, we need to construct the feature vectors for news and the vector space.  
Basically, we tried three methods of creating vectors:
- 0/1 method: word appears in text=1, else 0
- tf method: word frequency in text
- tf-idf value: tf-idf value of the word

Therefore, we have a dim(GOUP)+dim(GODOWN) dimension vector space.   

As for the distance function of kNN, which is Euclidean Distance.

Last, since we have three classes, we might encounter some problems while setting k=3.  
Thus, we find the **four** points which have minimum distances.   
After then, we tried to use majority voting of first three points to predict the value.  
If those three classes have the same vote (=1), we use the fourth neighbor's value as prediction.

### Result  
We did inside test to test the accuracy.

As a result, we got the best accuracy of:
- A company: 0.8277
- B company: 0.7469
- C company: 0.9066  
all with the tf-idf vector generation method.
