At the last semester of my college life, I decided to participate in exchange program to learn more about the world.   
As a result, I went to Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTUsg) as an exchange student.

My major was **Business and Computing**,    
which was initially a program of **college of computer sciecne** and **college of businsess**.  
  
As an exchange student,   
aside from regular academic study, working along with people from different countries is also essential.  

I have participated in 3 different projects with students from 7 countries:   
- Computational Thinking: Malaysia, Korean, Laos.

- School Database Design: Korean, Macau (China).     

Based on the working experiences with students from different countries, I understand that people from different backgrounds
(major, nationality, etc.) have different mindsets but also share common knowledge.    
Although there might be some incomfort at the very first, I really enjoyed the experiences to work along with them.    
Since we all had different background knowledge and experiences, we can come up with new ideas easily while discussing.   

Take the marketing project for example,  Italians can tell a lot about fast-fashion industry.    
Moreover, I got know to use how Milan's fashion industry is like as well.

I also explored the daily life in Singapore as well.  
In my opinion, Singapore is a great country that all races live in harmony, respecting each other's culture and values.  
Based on my experience, I would like to accumulate more experiences to work with people from different backgrounds, embracing 
diversity and gain more knowledge from all those different values.
